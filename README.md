## Running the challenges

Each challenge is in a single bin. Some have compilation rules for the
`"part1"` feature. Note that the `--features` and `--bin` options work for both
`cargo test` and `cargo run`. The bins *should* take the puzzle input via
stdin.

```bash
cargo run --features part1 --bin day_05 < ./input.txt
```
